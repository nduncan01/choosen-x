    <h2>Voice Assistance</h2>

    <p>When creating the voice assistance in this speaker, the team of Chosen-X speaker wanted to do something different then all of our other competitors. The voice assistance is named X and in order to set it up you push the voice assistance button on the speaker, the speaker will then give you a list of direction such as saying X multiple times so the speaker can remember your voice. </p>
