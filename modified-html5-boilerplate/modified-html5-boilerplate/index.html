    <h1> Welcome to Chosen-X Speaker</h1>

    
     <p> Chosen-X was invented by a young Male that attends Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. This young male goes by the name of Nicoral Duncan. Nicoral always enjoyed listening to music but after he bought so many speakers within his lifetime, he decided to create a speaker of his own. This speaker included features such as, voice assistance, Bluetooth, aux, and great sound quality. Choosen-X has yet to accomplish all of our goals but we are off to a great start to accomplish many.</p>

     <h2>Voice Assistance</h2>

      <p> When creating the voice assistance in this speaker, the team of Chosen-X speaker wanted to do something different then all of our other competitors. The voice assistance is named X and in order to set it up you push the voice assistance button on the speaker, the speaker will then give you a list of direction such as saying X multiple times so the speaker can remember your voice.  </p>
